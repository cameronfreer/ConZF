Native bounds. A small type `C : Type u` of certificates with a decoder `δ : C → PSet.{u}`
gives an unconditional ordinal `natBound δ = rank (range δ)`, and every ordinal that is not not
dominated by some `δ c` belongs to it (`mem_natBound_of_dominated`). Nothing is selected: the
range collects the values decoded from every certificate, and the negative existential is used
only to prove the stable membership.

The certificates of interest are well-founded relations on a small carrier `X`, with their
proof of well-foundedness (`WFCode X : Type u`). The decoder builds the tree of a point by
`Acc`-recursion on the certificate, and the height of a code is the rank of the range of its
trees. This is the same mechanism as the materializing recursion (`Mat.lean`): large
elimination of `Acc`, here on certificates that are data of a small type, rather than an
accessibility hypothesis about the sets.

/-! ### A test: the natural numbers present `ω`

The usual order on `Nat` has a certificate, and the height of the resulting code is `ω`: the
tree of `n` has rank `ofNat n`. So `ω` is below the bound decoded from the certificates on
`ULift Nat`. This is a native presentation of `ω`; it does not give, and does not need,
accessibility of `ω` under membership. -/
