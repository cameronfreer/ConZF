The pointwise-accessibility endpoint (conzf20, con33). The interval theorem no longer uses
excluded middle: negative accessibility of the height `K` of the lower universe, in the upper
universe (`NNAccK`), gives non-injectability of `K` into lifted lower sets by the accessibility
pullback, hence initiality and strong limitness; it gives lower membership accessibility
through the rank map, hence the interval regularity by the exact image of the definability
rule's Replacement; and the final split is by stability. Pointwise accessibility of the
hereditarily good ordinals of the seeded upper budget supplies both the syntactic class `MU` and
`NNAccK` (the seeded class contains its seed, whose rank is itself), so
`con_ZFCI_of_pointwise` derives the consistency of `ZFC + ∃ inaccessible` from that single
premise. Corollaries: from well-foundedness of upper membership, from irrefutable excluded
middle, and from excluded middle.
